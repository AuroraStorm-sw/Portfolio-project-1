## Website owner goals

The reason to create this website is to invite people who enjoy crocheting, no matter their skill level, to join a community with similar interests where they can learn new skills and start new projects and work on ongoing projects. Having a community can help in boosting creativity and bring inspiration. It is also a perfect space to share knowledge and learn tricks and tips from each other. This website will allow people to sign up to meet-ups and also provide their skill-level so the organizer can prepare to give them the proper attention.

## User goals

### First time visitor goals:
- users can learn what materials they need to bring to a meet-up
- users can find the location, times and dates for meet-ups
- users can use the contact form for questions

### Returning visitor goals:
- users can message the meetup coordinator with questions and feedback

## User stories

### As a website owner:

- I would like to present the page in a way that makes new users to feel welcome to join meetups no matter what skill-level they're currently at
- I want beginners to feel comfortable knowing what materials to bring to meetups
- I want to help users connect via meetups to share knowledge and experiences
- I would like to build a community where people feel comfortable sharing their crocheting journey

### As a new user:

- I want to know where and when the meetups are held
- I may need to know what materials to bring to a meetup in case something is available on the spot or if I need to bring all materials myself
- I need to be able to contact the organizer about any questions regarding meetups and materials

### As a returning customer:
- I need to know if any meetups are cancelled beforehand
- I want to be able to send questions or feedback to the organizer
