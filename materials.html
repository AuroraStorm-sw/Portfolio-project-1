                <h2>What yarn should I bring?</h2>
                <p>The world of yarn is vast and seemingly endless, and it comes down to what type of project you want
                    to make.
                    To narrow it down, here are the 2 most common types of yarn that you can look into.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Cotton yarn:</b> <br>
                        Cotton yarn is popular to use when you want to make lighter clothes like bralettes and tunics,
                        as well as
                        household items like dishcloths, market bags, and so on.
                        It's commonly used for baby items because it is easy-care, soft, and available in vibrant
                        colors. <br>
                    </li>
         
                    <li>
                        <b>Acrylic yarn:</b> <br>
                        Overall, acrylic is a popular fiber with crochet enthusiasts; acrylic is widely available,
                        it comes in a variety of colors, and it is usually one of the more affordable choices for yarn.

                <h2>What type of hook should I use?</h2>
                <p>The sea of hooks isn't near as vast as the one of yarn, but there are stiil many different sizes and
                    materials to
                    choose from. Here are the 2 most commonly used hooks to get you started;
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Aluminum:</b> <br>
                        Aluminium hooks are available a large range of sizes, often with a comfortable handle made from
                        silicone. They are popular
                        for all sorts of crocheting, and the metal makes it easy to work the yarn thanks to the smooth
                        surface.
                    </li>
             
                    <li>
                        <b>Plastic:</b> <br>
                        Plastic hooks are available in all the common sizes and they're easy to find in a large variety
                        of colors, with or
                        without glitter. Because of the lightweight, they can be made into jumbo sizes as well for those
                        big, chunky blankets.

                <h2>Bring scissors &mdash; and hold on to them!</h2>
                <p>Getting a specific pair scissors for crafting isn't mandatory, though it's widely suggested to use a
                    pair made for cutting yarn or
                    thread as they're generally sharper and easier to handle with their small size. Whatever fits your
                    fancy is what goes best,
                    you'll probably choose between:

                        <b>Ye old kitchen scissors:</b> <br>
                        As said, if all you have is a pair of kitchen scissors and you aren't intested in purchasing a
                        new one specifically for yarn,
                        that's perfectly fine. Just know they can be a bit clumsy!

                    <li>
                        <b>Yarn scissors:</b> <br>
                        Whether they're marketed for thread, embroidery, or needlepoint, these scissors are made for the
                        same job and come in a
                        variety of shapes. Some are shaped into animals, such as birds or even unicorns, while others
                        settle for a more discrete yet
                        fancy look, all in different price-ranges, so pick whichever fits your fancy and your wallet!
