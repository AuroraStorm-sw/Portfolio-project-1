        <h2>By crocheters, for crocheters</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to a space dedicted to sharing, learning, and connecting, where all skill-levels are welcome to
            weekly meetups.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, we want to bring together everyone who shares the passion of crafting so we can help each other grow
            and inspire one
            and another to pick that temperature blanket back up or weave in the ends of our scarfs &mdash; maybe even
            find the courage to tackle
            a bed spread or an intricate piece of clothing.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is also the perfect space for beginners who don't know how to start their journey where you can be
            personally guided through
            the vast sea of hook sizes, patterns, and yarn weights.
        </p>

        <h2>And did you know?</h2>
        <p>
            Humans have crafted since the beginning of our existance, and while today we might not need to rely as
            heavily on handicraft as then,
            we still find joy and satisfaction in creating something with our hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Crafting back then was combined with storytelling - throughout the years we've shared old legends and tales
            while passing our knowledge. <br><br>
            Now, crocheting isn't that old and only dates back to the early 1700's France. Compare that to knitting,
            which dates back to 11th century CE Egypt, crocheting is quite the modern craft. <br><br>
            Still, the crocheting community is large across the world, and here at Coffee & Crochet we invite you to
            join us in bringing back the old tradition of crafting and storytelling - with the addition of a steaming
            cup of coffee. <br><br>
